of name db , as this is the default path of the database server

--> If you want to do a custom path:    
    write
        mongod.exe --dbpath "path"

--> To open the ide of mongo 
    1- at first run the server and leave the cmd running it without closing
    2- open another cmd and run mongo.exe   // note server was mongod.exe but ide is mongo.exe
